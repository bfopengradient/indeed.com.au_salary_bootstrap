 
### Bootstrap salary from indeed.com.au scrape

Repo contains, 

Two data csv files. These are a sample of the data scraped from indeed.com.au

There are two py files. 
1. The isalary.py file contains a salary class that was used in the accompanying jupiter notebook. The salary class is used to analyse the indeed salary and      job title data.
2. The code to scrape is contained in the indeed_scrape.py file. This py file uses Chrome selenium and BeautifulSoup to obtain and parse the raw html/css/script data. 

Finally the notebook illustrates the salary class.
